## Why?
Patients might repeat the same prescription multiple times without doctors' knowledge which might be dangerous.
In need to prevent this situation, we introduce a portal where doctors can directly connect with the pharmacist specifying whether medicine should be repeated or not.
Patient can not meddle in between or can repeat the prescription without a doctors appointment.
